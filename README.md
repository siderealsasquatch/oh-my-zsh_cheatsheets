# `oh-my-zsh` cheatsheets

This repo contains a bunch of cheat sheets for the various features provided by
`oh-my-zsh` and its plugins. It should be noted that, at least for the plugins, I've
basically copied the `README.md` files for the plugins that provide useful aliases and
functions and modified them slightly.
